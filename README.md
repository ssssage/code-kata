 # Harry Potter Kata 
The Harry Potter Kata is a coding exercise that provides an opportunity to practice object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and clever optimization algorithms. Let’s delve into the details:

# Problem Description
A fictional bookshop offers five different Harry Potter books. To boost sales, they’ve introduced a discount system. Here are the rules:
1.	Base Price: Each copy of any Harry Potter book costs 8 EUR.
2.	Discounts:
o	If you buy two different books, you get a 5% discount on those two books.
o	If you buy three different books, you get a 10% discount.
o	If you buy four different books, you get a 20% discount.
o	If you go all out and buy all five books, you get a whopping 25% discount.
o	Note that if you buy, say, four books, of which three are different titles, you get a 10% discount on the three that form part of a set, but the fourth book still costs 8 EUR.

# Mission
Your task is to write a piece of code that calculates the price of any conceivable shopping basket containing only Harry Potter books, giving the maximum possible discount. For example, consider this basket:
•	2 copies of the Book I
•	2 copies of the Book II
•	2 copies of the Book III
•	1 copy of the Book IV
•	1 copy of the Book V
|Books	|Quantity	|Price
|1	     |1	      |8.00 EUR
|2	     |2	      |15.20 EUR
|3	     |3	      |21.60 EUR
|4	     |4	      |25.60 EUR
|5	     |5	      |30.00 EUR
|Total		        |51.20 EUR

 The answer should be 51.20 EUR. Here’s how the calculation works:

# Formula
To calculate the price, follow this formula:
•	For each set of different books, apply the appropriate discount.
•	Sum up the prices for all sets.

For example, the final price for the given basket is:
3 sets of 5 different books: 3 * (5 * 8 * 0.75) = 141.20 EUR
2 sets of 4 different books: 2 * (4 * 8 * 0.8) = 51.20 EUR


The Harry Potter Code Kata is a delightful exercise that not only hones your coding skills but also provides valuable insights into real-world problem-solving. Let’s explore its usefulness and how it relates to C# .NET jobs:

1.	# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Practice:
    o	The Kata encourages you to model the problem using classes and objects (such as Book and Basket).
    o	You’ll learn about encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism by designing classes that represent different aspects of the problem.

2.	# Algorithm Optimization:
    o	The challenge lies in finding an efficient way to calculate the maximum discount for a given set of books.
    o	You’ll explore strategies to group books into sets that minimize the total cost.
    o	This mirrors real-world scenarios where optimizing algorithms is crucial for performance.

3.	# Test-Driven Development (TDD):
    o	The provided test cases demonstrate TDD principles.
    o	You’ll write tests before implementing the solution, ensuring correctness and maintainability.
    o	TDD is a valuable skill in professional software development.

4.	# Problem Decomposition:
    o Breaking down the problem into smaller components (e.g., calculating discounts, managing book sets) is essential.
    o	In real-world projects, understanding how to decompose complex problems leads to better code organization.

5.	# Handling Business Rules:
    o	The Kata simulates business rules (discounts based on book combinations).
    o	In professional projects, you’ll encounter similar scenarios (e.g., pricing rules, promotions).
    o	Learning to translate business requirements into code is crucial.

6.	# Unit Testing and Assertions:
    o	The provided test cases validate correctness.
    o	In C# .NET jobs, writing unit tests ensures code quality and prevents regressions.

7.	# Code Review and Feedback:
    o	Posting your solution on platforms like Code Review Stack Exchange allows others to review your code.
    o	Constructive feedback helps improve your coding style and practices.

8.	# Community Learning and Collaboration:
    o	Katas are popular among developers, fostering a sense of community.
    o	Collaborating with others, sharing solutions, and learning from different approaches are essential skills.

9.	# Transferrable Skills:
    o	The problem-solving mindset developed during Katas translates directly to real-world projects.
    o	Whether you’re building web applications, APIs, or desktop software, the ability to tackle complex problems remains relevant.
 
 # Summay
 In summary, the Harry Potter Code Kata serves as a fun yet educational exercise that prepares you for real-world challenges in C# .NET development. By mastering the Kata, you’ll gain practical skills applicable to various job roles and projects.
